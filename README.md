# apple-catch
a game made in raylib about catching apples

# build
build with this command (you probably have to update file paths in the Makefile first):
```
make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP
```
or on windows:
```
mingw32-make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP
```
or for the web:
```
make web
```
append ```BUILD_MODE=RELEASE``` to any of the commands to build for release

Makefile was taken from a tutorial by Andrew Hamel and edited to fit the project
